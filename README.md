# M5-atom/stickc-Tesla charge door opener
Modified version of https://github.com/fredilarsen/TeslaChargeDoorOpener
<br><br>Tesla charge door opening, using cheap 433mhz transmitter and M5stack stuff. Arduino files for atom (works with lite and atomU) and M5stick in [[release](https://github.com/tompusey/M5-atom-stickc-Teslachargedooropener/releases/)]
both versions tested and working at various ranges depending on whether you solder the antenna on to the transmitter. Still testing how for it can reach as I don't own a tesla and have to find them in the wild and be able to see the charge door from a distance.



Started out when I realised the inputs on the back of the atom could line up nicely with the transmitter I had.

Plugs straight into the atom

All of the above can run off recycled vape pen batteries so long as you are super careful about re charging them. Do this at your own risk...
