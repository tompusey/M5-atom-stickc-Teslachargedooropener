# M5-atom-stickc-Teslachargedooropener
attempting to get tesla charge door opening using 433mhz transmitter and M5stack stuff (got some of it working, arduino files to come once I've tidied them up and annotated them)

Started out when i realised the inputs on the back of the atom could line up nicely with the transmitter I had.
